## Scope of 'Human Being Discoveries'\n\n### Focus Areas\n1. **Genetics**: Study of human genes, heredity, genetic disorders, and advancements in gene editing (e.g., CRISPR).\n2. **Anthropology**: Cultural, social, and biological aspects of humans, including evolution, societal structures, and human behavior.\n3. **Medicine**: Innovations in healthcare, treatments for diseases, public health strategies, and medical technology.\n4. **AI Ethics**: Ethical implications of AI development, bias mitigation, privacy concerns, and societal impact of automation.\n\n### Exclusion Criteria\n- Non-human biological studies (e.g., animal genetics).\n- AI technical specifications without ethical relevance (e.g., algorithmic efficiency).\n- Topics outside human-centric research (e.g., extraterrestrial life).\n\n### Research Boundaries\n- Adherence to ethical guidelines in human experimentation.\n- Interdisciplinary collaboration limited to human-focused domains.\n- Avoidance of speculative or unverified claims about human potential.
